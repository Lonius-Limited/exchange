## Exchange

Healthcare Information Exchange app - This is an ERPNext app designed based on the Open Health Information Exchange enterprise architecture to be the Interoperability Services Layer. It basically receives input from any point of service layer services (Electronic Medical Records, Community Health Information Systems, Lab Systems, HMIS, Logistics Systems and Insurance Systems) and standardizes this data by interlinking with the Registry Services before pushing the data to the Shared Health Record (Implemented based on FHIR).
